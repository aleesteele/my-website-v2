Dear all,

It's been a few months since I've arrived in Geneva. This is a fascinating place (though not without its challenges, of course), and I'm finally starting to feel settled. There's a lot to share, and that will take time to process, but I wanted to post a few photos of the past few months. I've been getting lots of mountain time, overdosing on politics, and studying up on just about everything. More on that later; but in a meantime, a few photos.

A view from my flat:

Climate protesters, which were the same day as the Free Tibet protests:

Fondue at one of my favorite places in Geneva (Bains des PÃ¢quis):

Many, many forums: on climate justice, on human-centred design, on Brazil's politique, on jewel auctions, and everything in between...

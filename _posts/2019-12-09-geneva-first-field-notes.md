Dear all,

It's been a few months since I've arrived in Geneva. This is a fascinating place (though not without its challenges, of course), and I'm finally starting to feel settled. There's a lot to share, and that will take time to process, but I wanted to post a few photos of the past few months. I've been getting lots of mountain time, overdosing on politics, and studying up on just about everything. More on that later; but in a meantime, a few photos.

A view from my flat:![flat](/v1582666518/room_with_a_view_gwikrm.jpg "flat")

Hiking home from the crag:

Climate protesters, which were the same day as the Free Tibet protests:

Fondue at one of my favorite places in Geneva (Bains des PÃ¢quis):

Many, many forums: on climate justice, on human-centred design, on Brazil's politique, on jewel auctions, and everything in between...

Finally, a photo of beautiful Lake Geneva at dusk:![](/v1582668146/lake_geneva_night_tecm6v.jpg "late geneva")

Talk soon!

Always,

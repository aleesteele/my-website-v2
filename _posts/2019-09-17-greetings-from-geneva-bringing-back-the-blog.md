Dear all,

Work and life has meant that I've been constantly on the move for the past few months (in all honesty- for the past few years is probably more realistic): somewhere between Kathmandu, Washington DC, and Bristol. It feels good to be living somewhere long(er) term, and I'm excited to be based in Geneva.

Being stationary usually means that there's time to reflect and digest. For the past few months, I've had the opportunity to go through arsenals of old photographs, writings, field notes and emails. While some of that has been [posted here](https://www.instagram.com/mmntsbyanne/), I thought it might be nice to have my own space (as separate from a social network).

This will be a place to post thoughts, reflections, and adventures (both physical and intellectual). I hope that I'll be able to back-post some old writings, specifically letters and photographs that were sent when I was more mobile than not. 

If anything, this blog is for those that were too far away to know what I was up to at the time, and for anyone that happens to be interested in what I'm up to these days. First and foremost however, this blog is for myself.

Always,

Anne

      Before moving to Switzerland, I <span class="bio-link" photo_url="bhutan3.png">researched conservation</span> in Bhutan, <span class="bio-link" photo_url="putney.png">led student expeditions</span> in Nepal, and <span class="bio-link" photo_url="data-viz.png">coded data visualizations</span> for a Washington DC think tank. As an undergraduate at Columbia University, I studied global cities and natural resource conflict and <span class="bio-link" photo_url="designs.png">designed media for student organizations</span> in New York City. I'm interested in how technology and the environment affect people and their politics, and I've written about <a href="https://consiliencejournal.org/article/investing-the-global-and-local-in-wangchuck-centennial-national-park-a-case-for-the-bhutanese-conservation-actors-in-between/" class="bio-link" photo_url="consilience.png">how important those in the middle</a> are for translating such complicated problems. For me, this means working between disciplines, and using modern tools to make them accessible.

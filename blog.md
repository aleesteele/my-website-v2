This is my blog for experiments, somewhere at the intersection of technology and geography.

Since 2017, I’ve been learning how to code. Before that, I was studying people in the Big Apple, and researching conservation and teaching students in the Himalayas. I’m particularly interested in the intersection of technology and geography (cc: geopolitics, sustainability, development). This blog is for my explorations, thoughts, and experiments at these intersections… maybe even a few photographs.

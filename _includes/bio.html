      Hello, I'm <span class="bio-link" photo_url="anne.gif">Anne Lee Steele</span>.

    <h3 class="bio-paragraph">
      I'm a MA candidate at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies, Geneva, a <a href="https://fellows.frictionlessdata.io/" class="bio-link" photo_url="frictionless.png">Reproducible Research Fellow</a> at the Open Knowledge Foundation, and a co-curator of <a href="https://www.supply-chains.us/" class="bio-link" photo_url="supply-chains.png">supply-chains.us</a>.

    Before moving to Switzerland, I <span class="bio-link" photo_url="bhutan3.png">researched conservation</span> in Bhutan, <span class="bio-link" photo_url="putney.png">led student expeditions</span> in Nepal, and <span class="bio-link" photo_url="data-viz.png">coded data visualizations</span> for a Washington DC think tank. As an undergraduate at Columbia University, I studied global cities and natural resource conflict and <span class="bio-link" photo_url="designs.png">designed media</span> for different organizations in New York City.

For me, this means working between disciplines, and using modern tools to make them accessible.

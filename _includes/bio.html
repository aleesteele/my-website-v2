    <h3 class="bio-paragraph">
      I'm a MA candidate at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies, Geneva, and a <a href="https://fellows.frictionlessdata.io/" class="bio-link" photo_url="frictionless.png">Reproducible Research Fellow</a> at the Open Knowledge Foundation.

    For me, research and multimedia are inextricably linked. As an anthropologist, I'm interested in the people & processes behind our digital lives (think: open source software, maps, and supply chains). Through writing, design, and digital art, I'm always trying to make these ideas accessible and engaging.

    Before moving to Switzerland, I <span class="bio-link" photo_url="bhutan3.png">researched conservation</span> in Bhutan, <span class="bio-link" photo_url="putney.png">co-led student expeditions</span> in Nepal, and <span class="bio-link" photo_url="data-viz.png">coded data visualizations</span> for a Washington DC think tank. As an undergraduate at Columbia University, I studied global cities and natural resource conflict. I also <span class="bio-link" photo_url="designs.png">designed media</span> for different organizations in New York City.

Dear all,

So much for using this blog! Sorry about the long break. Between graduate school and the pandemic, I've been struggling to keep up with writing regularly for anything not directly related to work and research.

The funny thing about having a blog during times of Twitter, Instagram, Medium, Substack, and TinyLetter is that blogging feels distinctly like speaking into the abyss. What role do they play these days? There's no ready-set audience, no possibility of payment, no algorithmic recommendation system. There's no comment section for feedback. No google ad-words. Just me and my lonely CMS, writing into/at the digital abyss.

Yet, there's something that I really like about this space. It feels like my own little patch of the world wide web. I guess in a lot of ways, it feels like a [digital garden](https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/02/17/building-digital-garden/), something that I own in a digital world populated by proprietary platforms. I'm currently building one for thoughts that aren't blog-worthy, to do [open ethnography](https://ethnographymatters.net/blog/2012/08/02/writing-live-fieldnotes-towards-a-more-open-ethnography/) and [live fieldnotes](https://www.ethnography.com/2012/08/this-week-in-ethnography-writing-live-fieldnotes-with-social-media-towards-a-more-open-ethnography-ethnography-matters/) for anyone who might be interested (stay tuned!).

I've been thinking about this "open" approach to writing. From where I stand, it has three problems. 

**The first is an obvious one – why do these musings have to be public in the first place?**

I struggle with this one the most. When listening to a podcast about [_Life by Algorithms_](https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/c-besteman-h-gusterson-life-by-algorithms-how-roboprocesses/id425683368?i=1000488461179)_,_ a new book by C. Besteman and H. Gusterson, the authors were pretty bleak. "The age of privacy is over," they said. Does this mean that the age of private thoughts or private acts are over, too? Do the photos that I took of my grandmother mean anything, when I don't share them with her? Or with anyone else at all?

The pressure to join social platforms and to live in a public way is itself well-documented. Because the majority of [social and public life is now on proprietary platforms](), especially during the pandemic, and because influencers have shown time and time again how [fame on the internet can lead lead to fame in real life](https://www.wired.com/story/what-is-an-influencer/), more than ever, sharing our lives in public feels like a way of manifesting social connections. Recording our lives seems like a way of connecting with strangers and friends in real time, or perhaps even creating new income streams and economic opportunities. 

Despite the hope that this perspective brings, I can't stop thinking about this by [Caroline Busta](https://www.documentjournal.com/author/caroline-busta/ "Posts by Caroline Busta"). She writes about [what counterculture looks like in the age of the internet](https://www.documentjournal.com/2021/01/the-internet-didnt-kill-counterculture-you-just-wont-find-it-on-instagram/), and how we're more likely to see countercultural work as anonymous and local rather than anything done in public, let alone on social media. Because all aspects of our social lives are intrinsically tied to an [attention economy](https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/nov/22/attention-economy-in-hyperdrive-how-tech-shaped-2010s-oliver-burkeman), one where a few dominant for-profit platforms benefit off of both the critics and the consumers, would keeping my thoughts to myself be the most effective (and least-destructive) way to reflect? Are there alternatives?

This leads to my second critique, regarding alternatives to the model we have now: 

**Does open thought /bring people together?  people together without propriety platforms and open communication?**

We have never existed in a better time to actually engage with different publics, and experiment with new ways of doing things. Yes, the fear of engaging with ([false consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_consensus_effect)) or having friends that are exactly like yourself ([homophily](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2006/10/16/why-everyone-you-know-thinks-the-same-as-you/0560e849-925e-42ca-a786-861d93db3dfa/)). But it's weird to recognize how used I am to real-time feedback, and the call/response that social platforms give content makers of any time.

[Decentralized platforms are increasingly trumpeted as an alternative to this, but I'm skeptical, especially after watching Silicon Valley (I know, I know. ](https://www.wired.com/story/the-decentralized-internet-is-here-with-some-glitches/)

I recently wrote an [op-ed for the Graduate Institute communications team ](https://www.graduateinstitute.ch/communications/news/open-movement-and-its-discontents)

But, on the other hand, I admit that I still believe in the liberating power of the internet, and the free 

##### So I guess the final question is: why am I still writing on this blog?

Well

Dear all,

So much for using this blog! Sorry about the long break. Between graduate school and the pandemic, I've been struggling to keep up with writing regularly for anything not directly related to work and research.

The funny thing about having a blog during times of Twitter, Instagram, Medium, Substack, and TinyLetter is that blogging feels distinctly like speaking into the abyss. What role do they play these days? There's no ready-set audience, no possibility of payment, no algorithmic recommendation system. There's no comment section for feedback. No google ad-words. Just me and my lonely CMS, writing into/at the digital abyss. 

Yet, there's something that I really like about this space. It feels like my own little patch of the world wide web. I guess in a lot of ways, it feels like a [digital garden](https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/02/17/building-digital-garden/), something that I own in a digital world populated by proprietary platforms. I'm currently building one for thoughts that aren't blog-worthy, to do [open ethnography](https://ethnographymatters.net/blog/2012/08/02/writing-live-fieldnotes-towards-a-more-open-ethnography/) and [live fieldnotes](https://www.ethnography.com/2012/08/this-week-in-ethnography-writing-live-fieldnotes-with-social-media-towards-a-more-open-ethnography-ethnography-matters/) for anyone who might be interested.

This "open" approach to writing has two problems. The first is an obvious one – why do these musings have to be public in the first place?

I struggle with this one the most. When listening to a podcast about [_Life by Algorithms_](https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/c-besteman-h-gusterson-life-by-algorithms-how-roboprocesses/id425683368?i=1000488461179)_,_ a new book by C. Besteman and H. Gusterson, the authors were pretty bleak. "The age of privacy is over," they said. Does this mean that the age of private thoughts is over, too? Do the photos that I took of my grandmother mean anything, when I don't share them with her? Or with anyone else at all?

The pressure to join social platforms and to live in a public way is itself well-documented. Because the majority of [social and public life is on proprietary platforms](), especially during the pandemic, and because influencers have shown time and time again how [fame on the internet can lead lead to fame in real life](https://www.wired.com/story/what-is-an-influencer/). 

I really liked this article by [Caroline Busta](https://www.documentjournal.com/author/caroline-busta/ "Posts by Caroline Busta") about counterculture in the age of the internet, and how .

> So what does today’s counter-hegemonic culture look like? It’s not particularly interested in being seen... But it does demonstrate a hunger for freedom—freedom from the attention economy, from atomization, and the extractive logic of mainstream communication. We can imagine collectively held physical spaces reclaimed from empty retail or abandoned venues hosting esoteric local scenes... deeper and closer connections made between people even while rejecting the platform’s compulsion to “like and share.” In the internet era, true counterculture is difficult to see, and even harder to find—but that doesn’t mean it’s not there.

But, on the other hand, we have never existed in a better time to actually engage with different publics, and experiment with new ways of doing things. Yes, the fear of engaging with ([false consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_consensus_effect)) or having friends that are exactly like yourself ([homophily](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2006/10/16/why-everyone-you-know-thinks-the-same-as-you/0560e849-925e-42ca-a786-861d93db3dfa/)). But it's weird to recognize how used I am to real-time feedback, and the call/response that social platforms give content makers of any time.

“A City Talks: Learning from Bogotá’s Revitalization” by Enrique Peñalosa

“Bus Rapid Transit: Is Transmilenio a Miracle Cure?” by Alan Gilbert

“Latin American Urbanization and Planning: Inequality and Unsustainability in North and South” by Thomas Angotti

Perhaps the most striking aspect of learning more about the South American urban structure is its reliance on the North, and the interconnectedness of the markets both ideologically and geographically that ultimately seems to cripple one for the profit of the other. Angotti’s assertion on this “international division of labor”, as previously explored last week vis a vis the NAFTA-officiated _maquiladoras_ of Mexico_,_ seems a fitting name for the exploitive policies of the global system, but does little to comment on internal ineffectuality (Angotti 12). Especially given the example of Bogotá’s revitalization and Brasília’s urban planning, Angotti’s neo-colonialist narrative focus is obviously and undoubtedly important, but it is ultimately ineffectual at proposing solutions for their current urban problems.

That is to say, the mimicry and exploiting of North America in the South clearly does not work -– and models are and should be developed that address the particularities of the Southern system. The real solutions proposed by “indigenous” planners and larger, local governments in Brazil and Colombia seem to be addressing these issues in an increasingly more progressive way: urban planning as a form of urban cohesiveness, public transit as uniting disparate peoples and parts of a city, etc. However, as Gilbert notes, the desire to mimic car-based urbanity of North America and ignore very clear ecological/environmental strain cannot be the method going forward, as well as the export-based economy that keeps social classes divided both literally (urban enclaves), socially and economically.

But what should be the method going forward? It was after reading these articles that it became clear that a truly globalized “Monroe” doctrine still lives in in much of Latin American and Caribbean politics, in that the current export model from one Southern-based economy primarily to the North creates an “Americas for the Americas” that seems connected, but is simply crystallized inequality. Despite these clear problems in Latin American metropolises, “characterized by mass poverty and environmental pollution” and gaping divides “between the metropolitan regions, small cities and rural towns”, they seem to only increase in population at unprecedented rates (12).

The challenge seems to lie in the ability of Latin America cities* to theorize, plan and implement an idea for a city that makes sense for the unique and specific problems that they face, like the aforementioned sprawl, inequality, urban primacy, and unofficial substandard housing (favelas, barriadas, etc.). Bogotá’s solution (as well as Mexico City’s from last week) seems like a proper example– one to be improved, but a model for innovation. The Brasília city planning example begs the question of whether the modernist structure worked because it was ultimately a product of Western (Parisian) exported ideas, or a modified version created specifically for the Brasilian styled city. Legitimizing “favelas” and other substandard/”self-help” housing has previously been proposed, but the problems of piping in resources like water and electricity post new, and infinitely more difficult problems (28).

Furthermore, the reliance of their industry on exports poses all the more problems, particularly the reliance on oil exports to the North. Given the new movement in the North towards “greener” and more efficient technologies, and their ttempt to wean themselves off of exports, this poses an immensely difficult quandary for the future of the South. Will increasing internal use of resources and production push for a more classical version of urban-manufacturing and industry? A replication of the revolutionist period? Or will they simply export elsewhere?

\*it is problematic to say all, because each has their nuances. But given the widespread use of the “Law of the Indies”, classifying them into similar groups makes sense.

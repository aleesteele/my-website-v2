    <h2>
      Hello, I'm <span class="bio-link" photo_url="anne.gif">Anne Lee Steele</span>. I'm a researcher, writer, and designer based in Geneva, Switzerland.
    </h2>

    <h3 class="bio-paragraph">
      Right now, I'm research assistant and MA candidate at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies, Geneva. I'm also a Reproducible Research Fellow at the Open Knowledge Foundation.
    </h3>

    <h3 class="bio-paragraph">
    Before moving to Switzerland, I <span class="bio-link" photo_url="bhutan3.png">researched conservation</span> in Bhutan, <span class="bio-link" photo_url="putney.png">led student expeditions</span> in Nepal, and <span class="bio-link" photo_url="data-viz.png">coded data visualizations</span> for a Washington DC think tank. As an undergraduate at Columbia University, I studied global cities and natural resource conflict and <span class="bio-link" photo_url="designs.png">designed media</span> for different organizations in New York City. I'm interested in how technology and the environment affect people and their politics (i.e. supply chains, crowdsourced labor, humanitarian tech), and I've written about how important <a href="https://consiliencejournal.org/article/investing-the-global-and-local-in-wangchuck-centennial-national-park-a-case-for-the-bhutanese-conservation-actors-in-between/" class="bio-link" photo_url="consilience.png">those in the middle</a> are for translating such complicated issues. For me, this means working between disciplines, and using modern tools to make them accessible.
    </h3>

    <h3 class="bio-paragraph">
    When I'm not on a computer, I'm usually <span class="bio-link" photo_url="mountains.jpg">outside</span>.
